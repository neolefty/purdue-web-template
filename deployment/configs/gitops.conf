# GitOps Lite Configuration
# This file configures the gitops-lite.sh deployment script
# Copy to: /opt/apps/{app-name}/gitops.conf

# Python version to use for the virtual environment
# If not set, defaults to system 'python3'
# Examples: python3, python3.11, python3.12, python3.13
PYTHON="python3.13"

# Note: All other deployment settings (database, domain, secret keys, etc.)
# are configured in the .env file, which is auto-generated from
# .env.production.example on first deployment.
#
# The .env file uses a single SITE_DOMAIN variable to automatically
# configure ALLOWED_HOSTS, CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS, and CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS.
