# Port Configuration for Docker Compose
# Copy this file to .env and adjust as needed

# Frontend port (default: 5173)
# Change this to run multiple instances of the app simultaneously
# Example: FRONTEND_PORT=5174 for a second instance
FRONTEND_PORT=5173

# Note: Database ports (PostgreSQL 5432, Redis 6379) are internal to Docker
# and don't need to be changed for multiple instances
